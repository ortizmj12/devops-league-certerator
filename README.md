# DevOps League Certerator

Random idea to use python to create your own [DevOps League](http://devopsleague.com/) cert.

You'll need Pillow to run this:

```$ pip install Pillow```

Make sure create-cert.py is executable:

```$ chmod +x create-cert.py```

Create your cert:

```$ ./create-cert.py```

Example cert:
